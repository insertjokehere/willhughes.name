I spend a fair amount of time each day listening to podcasts, mainly in the car getting to and from work, and over time have settled into a nice list of podcasts I obsessively listen to. The ones listed below are the ones I feel are worth talking about and giving a try if you haven't already.

They are by no means the only podcasts I listen to; I enjoy listening to [Radiolab]() and [Serial](), but others have heaped enough praise on them already, and so I don't feel a need to add to that.

Consider giving these a listen if you haven't already - some are funny, some informative (most are both), and I generally consider the time given listening to them well spent. There is a strong North American slant in this list, mainly due to the amount of funding and support organizations like PRX and NRP receive compared to equivalent organizations in Europe and Australasia. Hopefully the next time I compile a list like this there will be a bit more diversity to it.
