One of the weird things that happens as you go from being a teenager to being a student-who-is-still-a-teenager to being an actual bonafide adult is that you end up putting a lot of time and thought into purchacing decisions that you never really considered relevant before. I recently purchaced a microwave. I treated this process much like I would any other purchacing process for a piece of electronic goods; that is I went to a store, assessed which of the available

At the end of this, I had parted with a small sum of money, and in exchange was now the proud owner of... a microwave. A device which through the magic of radio makes cold things hot, frozen things a uniformly inappropriate temperature and warm things capable of melting through the bench. Sure, it has more features than the standard punch-in-the-time-and-press-go model - I am a bit of a geek after all - it has a preset for popcorn, it knows how to reheat baked beans, and it has a defrost setting that I guess technically isn't a bold-faced lie, given that things do get less frosty in places. What I am trying to say is that it does, essentially, perform the function that it is designed to perform.

It is also the most horribly agravating piece of consumer electronics I have ever purchaced, and I paid actual money for a cell phone that ran Windows Mobile.

Thats probably a little harsh. For the most part, the microwave does well. The display is clear and well laid out. The controls are reasonably intuitive and it only took me 30 seconds to figure out how to just start the damn timer already. This paticular piece of UX agravation comes about because of something I'm sure the designers of this device considered a bit of a corner case - people are generally speaking quite impatitiant, and that goes double when they are hungry. Consider this: you are a microwave, and someone has carefully entered - using your expertly designed and intuitive controls - that they want exactly four hundred grams of baked beans to be heated to 12 degrees beyond what a regular human could concieveably eat without causing significant burns. Your algorithms calculate that this will take six minutes and eighteen seconds, but oh! shock! four and a half minutes in someone opens your door.

This is something of a conundrum. You have some state that you wish to preserve, and you want to avoid situations where users are confused because they expect the device to be configured one way - beans, baked, far too hot - and find it reset back to the default, or equally as bad put something in the microwave hours later and press 'Go' expecting their mug of luke warm tea to be reheated for the default 30 seconds, and be shocked to find that is now a well cooked bean. This is mode-confusion: a device has multiple modes that it can be set to, and performs differently in different modes. If users aren't aware - or able to easily identify - what mode a device is in, they might supply inputs that are inappropriate for the mode without realizing it. This is a real problem for avionics and industrial control systems - several air accidents have occured because of mode confusion around automated pilot systems.
