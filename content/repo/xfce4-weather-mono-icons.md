xfce4 Mono Weather Icons originally by [Golan77](http://golan77.deviantart.com/art/Mono-Dark-icons-for-xfce4-weather-plugin-337247416), with a light variant added by [Kevlar1818](https://github.com/kevlar1818/xfce4-weather-mono-icons). I packaged this up to make it easier to install on my desktop machines.
