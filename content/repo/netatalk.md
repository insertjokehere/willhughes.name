The version of Netatalk that ships in Ubuntu and Debian is far too old to be useful - there has been [an open bug report](https://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=690227#81) in the Debian tracker since 2012 asking for a newer version to be packaged. This is a much more modern version build for Wheezy and Xenial. Useful if you want to run a Timemachine server to backup some macOS devices.
